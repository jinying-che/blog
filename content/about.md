I'm Jinying Che from China, currently living in **Singapore** and working for **Shopee** as a senior software engineer. I started working from 2014 when I graduated from the Beijing Institute of Technology. I love coding that is the main reason why I become who I am now, when I write the code, I think it's no difference with writting the article or novels, it's a really creative and interesting job, besides, humans are always complex, but computers are simple which is only 0 and 1, is it? 

#### Army 
I worked for Army at the beginning of my career when I graduated, actually it's not mysterious at all as you guys may imagine, at least regarding my role, I just built the website including frontend and backend as a full stack engineer, the technical I used was also not cool, Extjs for FE, Servlet and Mysql for BE. I also built some CS applications in C#. 

#### JD 
I joined JD after I quited from Army three years later, I built an account and schedule system for warehouse using Spring, Bootstrap, Mysqland JMQ(MQ framework inside JD) also as a full stack engineer, the tech I learned and used here was indeed intersting, but to be honest, for the toB system, I felt boring already, the most important things is the porformance of this kind of system is not required high, I would like to challenge myself more, by the way, the FE tech was no longer attract me.

#### MOMO 
As I wished, I joined the Quick Chat Team in MOMO which is ToC product, the users can chat with each other via voice and video, I wrote the business logic and exposed API for app (no longer for Web), since then, I started to use Redis which is a really amazing project ([antirez](https://github.com/antirez) is cool). The data structure in Redis is designed beautifully, all the implementations that product required were basing on it. 

After that, I started to be interested in IM system, as you know, initially MOMO is a social platform for strangers, so I tried to understand how the **Instant Message** are handled in my spare time.
